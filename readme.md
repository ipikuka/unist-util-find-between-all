## What is this?

This is a tiny utility that you can use to find nodes between two nodes or
indexes in a parent.

## When should I use this?

This is super tiny.
You can of course do it yourself.
But this helps when integrating with the rest of unified and unist.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install unist-util-find-between-all
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {findAllBetween} from 'https://esm.sh/unist-util-find-between-all@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {findAllBetween} from 'https://esm.sh/unist-util-find-between-all@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {u} from 'unist-builder'
import {findAllBetween} from 'unist-util-find-between-all'

const tree = u('tree', [
  u('leaf', 'leaf 1'),
  u('parent', [u('leaf', 'leaf 2'), u('leaf', 'leaf 3')]),
  u('leaf', 'leaf 4'),
  u('parent', [u('leaf', 'leaf 5')]),
  u('leaf', 'leaf 6'),
  u('empty'),
  u('leaf', 'leaf 7')
])

console.log(findAllBetween(tree, 1, 5, 'leaf'))
```

Yields:

```js
[
  {type: 'leaf', value: 'leaf 4'},
  {type: 'leaf', value: 'leaf 6'},
]
```

## API

This package exports the identifier [`findAllBetween`][api-find-all-between].
There is no default export.

### `findAllBetween(parent, child|index, child|index[, test][, options])`

Find the nodes in `parent` between two `child`s or indexes, that pass `test`.

###### Parameters

*   `parent` ([`Node`][node])
    — parent node
*   `index` (`number`)
    — index of child in `parent`
*   `child` ([`Node`][node])
    — child in `parent`
*   `test` ([`Test`][test])
    — `unist-util-is`-compatible test
*   `options` ([`{behaviour: "include" | "exclude"}`][options])
    — The behaviour for including or excluding (default) both sides (optional).

###### Returns

Children of `parent` ([`Array<Node>`][node]).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types (types for the test are in `unist-util-is`).

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
